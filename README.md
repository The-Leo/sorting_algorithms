# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project aided me to grasp the  following concepts:
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
